    "For this analysis, we were given a dataset composed of 8 columns and 77536 rows holding information about credit borrowers and we were tasked with predicting their credit worthiness or the outcome of each loan application .For that purpose, we created a  Logistic Regression model by completing the following tasks.\n",
    "- We started off  by reading the `lending_data.csv` into a pandas dataframe and acknowledged the existence of the following columns in the dataset.['loan_size','interest_rate','borrower_income','debt_to_income','num_of_accounts','derogatory_marks\t','total_debt','loan_status'].\n",
    "-With that knowledge , the next step was to predict the 'loan_status' for each applicant based on the following criterias. \n",
    "'loan_size','interest_rate','borrower_income','debt_to_income','num_of_accounts','derogatory_marks','total_debt'.Therefore the outcome 'loan_status' column became our label whereas the criterias columns were used as features. We separated both components of the dataframe and stored them in sapare variables. Ultimately, we aimed to determine whether the combination of features for each applicant scored a `0`or`1`  , effectively solving the equation y = aX+b where y=1 translated as (high-risk loan)application and y = 0 translated as (healthy loan) application.\n",
    "- Furthermore , we used the function `train_test_split` imported from the `sklearn.model_seletion' library to split each component of\n",
    "the data into 2 buckets. 'train' and 'test' at a random state of 1.\n",
    "-Then ,using the LogisticRegression algorithm imported from sklearn.linear_model, we instantiated a `logistic regression model' with the random_state of 1 and solver `lbfgs`which is a popular optimization algorithm , very efficient at handling large datasets like the one at hand and also helpful for dealing with many parameters as we did in this case study.\n",
    "-Finally , we fitted the model using the `X_train` and the `y_train` and made some predictions using the X_test splitted data ,then evaluated the model performance by generating a confusion matrix and printing a classification report using the `classification_report`  imported from the sklearn.metrics library.\n"

    "19384 times it ran through the testing dataset, leaving a margin of error of just 158 accross both components.This means that the accuracy of the model prediction sit at a whooping 99%.\n",

    "18765 represented the total of'healthy loan' versus '619' representing the 'high risk loan'.This means that we trained our model to recognised mostly healthy loan\n",

    "Overall I would say that supervised learning algorithms in general do a great job at predicting data ,but as for this case study , the risk of bias that comes with human input kind of make it subjective. that's the reason why i think that for total transparency using unsupervised machine learning algorithm like the kmeans or Birch models is preferred."
